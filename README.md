# Cross Stitch
Auto-generate a mountable pattern library from sass files.


### The Problem
Writing modular, reusable sass takes some ... encouragement. The goal of this
project is to help users create an easy to use modular pattern library. It should
a) create a file structure scaffolding with boilerplate rules, and b) display
the output of those files in an auto-generated style pattern library, so that the
user can think about those rules independently of their application.

The idea is to get the project up and running quickly, while encouraging you to
think about your styles as modular pieces.

### Project Inspiration
I've been kicking this idea around since a bout of reading that started with Jonathan
Snook's [SMACSS - Scalable and Modular CSS](https://smacss.com/, 'SMACSS -
Scalable and Modular CSS'), and Brad Frost's article on [atomic
design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/, 'atomic design'), which
advocate building web design from small, modular pieces, starting with
the basic elements of html and building up a set of combinable pieces.

I'm also inspired by Mailchimp's [Pattern Library](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns),
and think it should be easy to create your own.
